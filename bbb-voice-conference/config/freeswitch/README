Version 1.0.6 of Freeswitch or greater tested on the git master 
 commit 1eb4b79c15feb81e4eb5370c911267c4f11e3d52
 Date:   Wed Jun 16 01:12:47 2010 +0200

this conf dir is the freeswitch config setup for a bbbuser and 
 auto created conferences dialed via sip from the regex ^8{4}$ 
 meaning that you can use this for auto generated confrence 
 handling for confrence ids between 80000 and 89999

To install this config you would move /usr/local/freeswitch/conf to /usr/local/freeswitch/conf.dist
mv /usr/local/freeswitch/conf /usr/local/freeswitch/conf.dist
and 
cp -a conf /usr/local/freeswitch/

conf.orig dir is what was installed by freeswitch by default 
 with my mods to support just 85{3} conf ids but also includes
 all the extra demo and example stuff.

NOTE: you must double check this config if you intend to have 
 the freeswitch server on a public facing interface. 
 It defaults to localhost for the event socket inteface.

 I run my server in a test environment with 
  /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch -hp -nc
 and then interact with it via
  /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli
